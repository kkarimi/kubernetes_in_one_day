# All together, now!

By now, we have covered:

    * Deployments
    * ReplicaSets
    * Pods
    * Services
    * ConfigMaps
    * Secrets
    * Jobs


Let's see if we can do an exercise that brings all these things together.

## The Challenge

We need to run a web server that uses SSL certificates with, at least, 3 instances.


## A layeRED challenge

Business has decided that we have to go live today. You need to deploy a database, a microservice that reads data from that database and a web frontend highly available. To make things worse, the CEO has decide to broadcast live the new launch of the platform and he has requested that with only one command the platform goes from zero to live.

It's your duty as the CTO to deliver!
